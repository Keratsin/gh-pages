  <h1>GitHub Notes</h1>
  <h2>Lets start with some basics:</h2>
  <p>- Fork is a copy of repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Used by accounts different from the owner of the repo.</p>
  <p>- Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with new ideas in contained area of your repo. Branch is always created from an existing branch (typically main/master/default branch).</p>
  <p>- Open issue can be closed by placing in the commit “fixes #5” (5 is for example) or by placing the hash code.</p>
  <p>- Pull requests let you tell others about changes you`ve pushed to a branch in a repository in GitHub.</p>
  <p>- Merge a pull request into the upstream branch when work is completed. Anyone with push access to the repository can complete the merge.</p>
  <p>- Clone a repository by pulling it from remote location on your PC, edit it and push it back to the server.</p>
  <p>- Cloning is taking (pulling) repository from a web server on your local machine then you can push it back.</p>
